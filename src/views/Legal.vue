                <h3>How do we use cookies?</h3>
                <p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree,
                    the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular
                    site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its
                    operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your
                    preferences.</p>
                <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page

                    statistical analysis purposes , after which the data is removed from the system.</p>
                <p>Cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and
                    which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other
                    than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Many web browsers
                    automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
                    prefer. You should note though that this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>
